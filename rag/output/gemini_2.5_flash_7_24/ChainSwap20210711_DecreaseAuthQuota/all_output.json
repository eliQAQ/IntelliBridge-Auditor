The logic flow uses 'to' as an address to receive the funds, not to directly identify the target chain's ID.

The ambiguity arises because the system could be designed to infer the target chain from the 'to' address context, or it could inherently operate on a pre-defined target chain once the transaction reaches this contract. In this specific context, 'to' is the destination address on *this* chain where the 'receive' function is called, which by extension typically implies this chain is the 'toChainID'.
