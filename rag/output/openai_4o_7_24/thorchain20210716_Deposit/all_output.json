However, the 'credit to chosen vault' `vaultAllowance[vault][asset] += safeAmount;` will indeed reflect this lower `safeAmount`.

However, the 'credit to chosen vault' `vaultAllowance[vault][asset] += safeAmount;` will indeed reflect this lower `safeAmount`. The 'validation' statement implies a check for the exact `amount` transferred, but the code explicitly performs a balance difference check, thus `safeAmount` is accurate to what was *actually* transferred to the contract. The 'poc' correctly points out that `safeAmount` might be less than `amount` without reverting, which is true because the code is designed to handle this by using the balance difference. The 'validation' as stated is not strictly bypassed, but rather the `safeAmount` accurately reflects the *actual* transfer, which could be less than the nominal input `amount` due to token mechanics.
