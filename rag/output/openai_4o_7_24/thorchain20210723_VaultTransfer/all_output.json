The system relies on the `approve` and subsequent `depositWithExpiry` call to the external `_router` address, meaning the authorization is determined by the external router contract's logic for processing deposits. The 'authorization' is whether the `_router` contract is the intended one to interact with, rather than a whitelisted 'user' that is authorized to call this function. The constraint 'authorized to use' is interpreted as 'can be interfaced with'. The code handles two cases: the router being the contract itself, or an external router. For the external router, it attempts to interact with it, implying it's 'authorized' if the interaction is successful. There's no explicit whitelist or ownership check for the `_router` address itself within this snippet. This is typical for trustless interactions where the 'authorization' is simply the ability to send tokens to an address that can process them.

The provided code does not specify the Solidity pragma, but assuming a modern compiler or safe math checks, this vulnerability would not manifest as described. However, if the contract uses an older Solidity version or has `unchecked` blocks around this specific operation, then the underflow behavior could indeed lead to the described bypass. Without knowing the Solidity version, a definitive 'revert' cannot be assumed, but the risk described is significantly mitigated in modern Solidity.

An `approve` call is to grant authorization to another address. The `vaultAllowance` modification `vaultAllowance[msg.sender][_asset] -= _amount;` affects an internal tracking mechanism, not the token's inherent authorization. The original code snippet `_routerDeposit` does use `_asset.call(abi.encodeWithSignature(\"approve(address,uint256)\", _router, _amount));` to grant transferability to the `_router`, which aligns tangentially with the spirit of authorization for subsequent use by the router. However, the phrasing \"authorized to use\" for the `tokenAddress` itself is a bit ambiguous; if it means if `msg.sender` has the right to interact with the token, this isn't checked here directly. If it means if the token is an authorized token in the protocol, that's not checked either. Given the context of `_routerDeposit`, the `approve` call is indeed a necessary step for the router to use the token, so it partially aligns.
